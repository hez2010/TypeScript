# Phase 4: checker port in progress

**Phase 4 is incomplete.** This checkpoint implements checker type representation, identity and resolution state. It does not satisfy the complete semantic-checker gate in the [rewrite plan](csharp-rewrite-plan.md). Semantic diagnostics, full type/symbol queries and emit-resolver queries remain unavailable in the C# backend.

## Implemented checkpoint

`csharp/src/TypeScript.Compiler/Checking/` contains manually ported algorithms and generated flag declarations from the pinned Go checker:

| Area | Implemented responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `Types.cs` | Typed representations for intrinsic/literal, object/reference/interface/tuple, mapped/reverse-mapped/evolving-array, union/intersection, parameter, index/indexed-access, template/string-mapping, substitution and conditional types; signatures, predicates and index information. Representation alone does not implement evaluation of these types. |
| `TypeContext.cs` | Exclusive type ownership; intrinsic distinctions; string/number/bigint/enum literal interning; fresh/regular literal identity; reference, union, generic-index and substitution cache primitives; signature creation/cloning. |
| `TypeOrder.cs` | Deterministic type order, including declaration/file order, named aliases, type arguments, mapper composition, literal values, tuples and composite types. UTF-8/WTF-8 ordering preserves supplementary characters and lone surrogates. Input-shaped comparisons use an explicit stack. |
| `TypeMapper.cs` | Direct, array-to-single, deferred, function, merged and composite mappings; prepend/append; distributed parameter normalization. Composite instantiation is supplied by the caller. BCL `ValueTask` continuations preserve stack space during re-entry. Inference mappers require the later inference port. |
| `Links.cs` | Sparse per-checker link tables and circular-resolution detection. Resolved properties terminate cycle searches; failed pushes mark participating frames without adding another frame; resolution boundaries isolate nested computations. |
| `Flags.generated.cs` | Source-hashed type/object/signature/element/index/access/variance/check flags and resolution/predicate enums. `generate-checker.mjs --check` verifies freshness. |

Type and signature IDs are local to their owning context. Factories reject combinations from different contexts. Cache keys compare complete identity sequences, including alias arguments and union origins; a hash collision cannot merge unrelated types. Caller-owned arrays are copied before they enter retained type state. Links remain separate from the AST and binder symbols shared by programs.

The union factory implemented here is `getUnionTypeFromSortedList`, the canonicalization primitive called after normalization in Go. It does not implement `getUnionTypeWorker`, subtype reduction, intersection distribution, template reduction or constrained-variable reduction. These operations must be ported before the factory can support general semantic checking.

## Executed validation

The published Windows x64 NativeAOT harness passes **2,904 exact differential cases**, comprising **1,333,980 constructor, mapper, resolution and ordering operations**. No comparison policy permits differences in this suite. Probe serialization represents process-local type identities as graph references so sharing, freshness, targets and origins remain observable.

Fixtures include NaN payloads and signed zero, large bigint literals, Unicode/lone-surrogate strings, duplicate enum values, repeated cache requests, strict-null and exact-optional configurations, mapper precedence and repeated deferred evaluations, all ten circular-resolution properties, and deterministic comparison across composite types.

The mapper probe isolates composition using atomic replacements. Its candidate-side callback implements the corresponding atomic instantiation behavior, including the reference's lazy flag updates, and rejects structural inputs. Passing these cases does not establish structural generic instantiation or inference correctness.

An additional **41 native ownership/state assertions** cover immutable inputs, cross-context rejection, signature cloning, cancellation recovery and concurrent independent contexts. Mapper traversal, re-entrant composite instantiation and type ordering run at **50,000 levels**. Sixteen independent contexts exercise cache isolation. These checks do not establish full-checker recursion safety or compiler scheduling parity.

Evidence: [differential summary](../csharp/compatibility/evidence/phase4-type-state.json) and [native state/build/repository validation](../csharp/compatibility/evidence/phase4-type-state-validation.json). Records retain the exact toolchain and candidate/oracle hashes. Validation uses SDK `11.0.100-rc.2.26470.103`, C# 15, `runtime-async=on`, `OptimizationPreference=Speed` and `IlcInstructionSet=native`, with compiler/trimming/AOT warnings treated as errors. No dependencies were added. Go is used exclusively by the development oracle. These correctness tests are not compiler performance measurements.

Reproduce from the repository root after preparing the frozen reference checkout:

```powershell
node csharp/tools/generate-checker.mjs --check
node csharp/tools/checker-types.mjs --record phase4-type-state
& ./built/csharp/phase4-native/TypeScript.Compatibility.exe --checker-state
```

The runner accepts `--managed`, `--no-build`, `--go` and `--dotnet`. `--reference-only` runs just the Go fixtures. Failures retain complete inputs and reference/candidate outputs in `built/csharp/checker-types-failures.json`. The test-only bridge is copied into the ignored pinned checkout; it does not modify the product Go checker.

## Remaining completion work

The following phase-4 requirements remain open:

1. Program/checker integration, global merging, name and alias resolution, module exports/augmentations and type/value symbol resolution.
2. Complete union/intersection normalization, structural relations and their caches, constraints, generics and structural instantiation, including reference instantiation limits.
3. Inference, contextual typing, signatures and overload selection, expression/declaration checking, JavaScript and JSDoc semantics.
4. Flow analysis and narrowing, evolving arrays, definite assignment, exhaustiveness and semantic diagnostics.
5. Mapped, conditional, indexed-access and template type evaluation; JSX, decorators and grammar checks.
6. Type display, node builders, symbol accessibility and emit-resolver APIs.
7. All active checker/compiler type/symbol/diagnostic comparisons at single and reference-default concurrency; audits of intentional differences; complete semantic workload memory/performance measurements.

The next integration step is symbol/name resolution and declared-type construction over the phase-3 program and binding model. The original Go backend remains the product backend. The full checker completion gate and retained-platform release gates are unchanged.
